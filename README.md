_SelfAI 是一个能够接收命令并进行硬件和软件控制的人工智能。_

##原理

According to the train with input and output, the SelfAI can grow up and become more intelligent. Simplily, the AI can receive the message(voice , gesture) then u can try some related operations , the AI can transfer the operations to some related control commands, and remember the input and consider the related and useful commands as output. Besides, the AI will study by the set of the input and output, next time, u send or say or do some message, the AI knows what u want and what should be done.

_通过不断进行输入和输出的训练，从而使其能够不断成长。比较通俗的说法是，AI接收声音，手势等指令，作为输入，人进行一些操作，AI将会将这些操作进行记录病转化抽取出相关的控制指令， 并且记录下来，作为输出。AI就可以进行自我学习根据这些输入和输出。下一次，当你发出相关信息或者指令，AI就会明白你的意思，进行操作。_
